          <!-- About Hero self  -->
          <p>
            I'm Sudhin Raj B S, a passionate self-taught 
            developer from Kerala, India, with a deep drive 
            to build, learn, and grow. My journey into 
            tech began without a formal degree — 
            I only completed my SSLC — but that didn’t 
            stop me from diving deep into the world of 
            computers, coding, and problem-solving.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve trained myself in front-end 
            development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and I'm now 
            expanding into React and full-stack technologies. 
            I regularly help BTech students understand coding 
            concepts, build projects from scratch, and explore 
            how software can solve real problems. Teaching others
            has not only strengthened my own skills but also 
            fueled my passion for making tech more accessible.
            I’m currently working towards becoming a full-time 
            developer and eventually want to specialize in iOS 
            development using Swift. I love Apple products and 
            dream of building sleek, powerful apps that live on 
            millions of iPhones someday.
            Outside of code, I’m a tech enthusiast who follows 
            creators like MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss. I’m also 
            obsessed with typing — practicing every day on 
            Monkeytype to reach peak speed and accuracy. 
            I'm a big believer that consistency and grit are 
            more powerful than any degree.
            This portfolio is just a small window into who I am 
            and what I’m building. I’m always open to 
            collaboration, learning from others, and taking 
            on new challenges that push me forward.
